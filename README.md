##Rice up


I'm relatively new to CSS, so i don't know thath much about it: any help is warmly welcomed.


I'm going to release two more versions of this theme: "Material Light" and "Material Editable".
In the Material Light edition, the color scheme will be reversed, and in the Material Editable, the colors will be easily accessible and fully customizable.
I can't state a defined ETA, so come back here frequently to check if a new version is avaliable.
